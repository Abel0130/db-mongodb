first day:

1.install a mongodb

download mongodb from website,then unzip it to a location where you want,

2.start service

open "cmd" line,then input cmd : cd ***/bin change to your mongodb location which you set before,

EO next cmd:mongod.exe --dbpath=**/db(where you want to put you db data) you can start the server.

If you don't you will get a message "由于你的计算机积极拒绝,无法连接 127.0.0.1:27017",

but if you get this message,this tip may don't do well,good luck!

3.check the connection

mongo.exe will do help

4.create db

use db

cmd:use [newDBname] (this won't create a db immediately just change the db to [newDBname],but after you insert data),here I use Eclipse as example

insert data

cmd:db.user.insert({"name":"abel","password":"abel","sex":"male"})

db will do three operations:create a db named eclipse,create a collection named user,insert a record to collection user
